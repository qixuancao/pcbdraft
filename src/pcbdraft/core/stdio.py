"""Windows UTF-8 bootstrap for Hermes entry points.

Python on Windows has two long-standing text-encoding footguns:

1. ``sys.stdout`` / ``sys.stderr`` are bound to the console code page
   (``cp1252`` on US-locale installs), so ``print("café")`` crashes with
   ``UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character``.

2. Child processes spawned via ``subprocess`` don't know to use UTF-8
   unless ``PYTHONUTF8`` and/or ``PYTHONIOENCODING`` are set in their
   environment — so any Python subprocess (the execute_code sandbox,
   delegation children, linter subprocesses, etc.) inherits the same
   cp1252 defaults and hits the same UnicodeEncodeError.

This module fixes both on Windows *only* — POSIX is untouched.  It
should be imported at the very top of every Hermes entry point
(``hermes``, ``hermes-agent``, ``hermes-acp``, ``python -m gateway.run``,
``batch_runner.py``, ``cron/scheduler.py``) before any other imports
that might do file I/O or print to stdout.

What this module does on Windows:

  - Sets ``os.environ["PYTHONUTF8"] = "1"`` (PEP 540 UTF-8 mode) so
    every child process we spawn uses UTF-8 for ``open()`` and stdio.
  - Sets ``os.environ["PYTHONIOENCODING"] = "utf-8"`` for belt-and-
    suspenders — some tools read this instead of / in addition to
    ``PYTHONUTF8``.
  - Reconfigures ``sys.stdout`` / ``sys.stderr`` to UTF-8 in the current
    process, using the ``reconfigure()`` API (Python 3.7+).  This fixes
    ``print("café")`` in the parent without a re-exec.

What this module does NOT do:

  - It does not re-exec Python with ``-X utf8``, so ``open()`` calls in
    the *current* process still default to locale encoding.  Those need
    an explicit ``encoding="utf-8"`` at the call site (lint rule
    ``PLW1514`` / ``PYI058``).  Ruff is the right tool for that sweep.

What this module does on POSIX:

  - Nothing.  POSIX systems are already UTF-8 by default in 99% of cases,
    and we don't want to touch ``LANG``/``LC_*`` behavior that users may
    have configured intentionally.  If someone hits a C/POSIX locale on
    Linux, they can export ``PYTHONUTF8=1`` themselves — we won't override.

Idempotent: safe to call multiple times.  ``_bootstrap_once`` guards
against double-reconfigure.

    CPython's ``platform.win32_ver()`` (reached via ``platform.uname()`` /
    ``platform.platform()``, which the OpenAI SDK touches for its
    platform headers) shells out ``cmd /c ver``. Two failure modes:

    - **Console flash**: the ``check_output(..., shell=True)`` call has no
      ``CREATE_NO_WINDOW``, so a windowless parent (pythonw gateway, slash
      workers, kanban workers) flashes a visible console per call.
    - **UnicodeDecodeError on Python 3.11.0/3.11.1**: those micros lack
      CPython's ``encoding="locale"`` fix (added 3.11.2), so under PEP 540
      UTF-8 mode (which we enable above) the ``ver`` output — OEM code page
      bytes on localized Windows — is strict-utf-8 decoded and raises,
      crashing ``platform.platform()`` in any process that inherits
      ``PYTHONUTF8=1`` (issue #69413).

    Stubbing ``_syscmd_ver`` to return its inputs makes ``win32_ver()`` hit
    its documented fallback and read the version from
    ``sys.getwindowsversion()`` — same data, in-process, no subprocess.
